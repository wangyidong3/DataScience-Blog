#### Mission and plan
Crazy, brave and wise is the most charming character I appreciate before, now the words are discpline, efficent and passionate, God, I have been evolved into a totally new species. not only the one I want incredible miracle , magic, but also the largest mission and motivation inside. affirmation spread out, generate the whole
relationship can be maintained, just like company, that's why we call it company! a new format of collaboration and take you to the change your relationship and friends circles. To be the stage you belongs to, the people you adore, their life they already build a model to show you.
You write slowly, just because you want your writing to be masterpieces.No, just a card which you can organize them later. Each is idea and realize the feeling of shame. Enjoy it. 
Now it's time to change my environment, my purpose is to build new relationship, only goal inside is Sydney. So how can I touch it? living closely with it. Good relationship bases on the

Tips for Deep Reinforcement learning:
- Best resource: [Spinning Up in Deep RL] (https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html), include workshop in youtube.
- other online course on udacity and udemy.     Watch it at 2x.
- Take handwritten notes. This will drastically increase your ability to retain the information.
- Write down the equations. If you don't, I guarantee it will just look like gibberish.
- Ask lots of questions on the discussion board. The more the better!
- Be prepared, Realize that most exercises will take you days or weeks to complete.
- Keep coding! Write code, don't just sit there and look at my code.

Machine learning Deployment
1. Build package for the predection model.
2. RESTful API.
3. Flask crash course 
4. API schema validation. 

Deep RL
1. Resource collection


### 2019-03-05
Deployment for ML
1. Deploy to PaaS (without container)
Deep RL 
1. random search implement on OpenAI gym.  It is the basic Reinforcement learning idea and demo.



### 2019-03-06
Deployment for ML
1. Coninuious Integration tool: CircleCI vs Jenkins
2. pytest usage: easy & good tool for UT
3. make Docker  file for Model


### 2019-03-07
Deployment for ML
1. Deply to IAAS (AWS ECS)

Deep RL
1. paper reading  (recommanded by spinning up)
2. Deep RL spinning up workshop (youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdY7dt3ijgY&t=6753s)

The point of deep learning frameworks
(1) Easily build big computational graphs
(2) Easily compute gradients in computational graphs
(3) Run it all efficiently on GPU (wrap cuDNN, cuBLAS, etc)


#### Thought 
- The one of the advantages of Computational Graphs is that it is more suitable for computation of gradients
- numpy vs tensorflow vs pytorch:  focus on the implement of Computational Graphs.
numpy can run on the gpu.  tensorflow use the static computatuional graphs. pytorch use dynmatic graphhs.

The tons of new concepts relate to Reinforcement Learning, such as meta learning, few-shot/one-shot learning.
Eg, for few-shot learning, 5 methods are considerable:
- Finetune-based
- Metrics-based
- Graphic NN
- Siamese Neural Networks
https://blog.csdn.net/qq_16234613/article/details/79902085
There is impressing work on meta-RL and blog on RL progress in https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/

Even there are lots of framework and library help me to simplify the workload:
Spark Vs Ray,TensorFlow Agents,Roboschool, intel Coach
Ray,haha, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05889.pdf
ok, endless learning...
